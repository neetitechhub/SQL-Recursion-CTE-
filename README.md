# SQL-Recursion-CTE-


**RECURSION** IS DEFINED AS A PROCESS WHICH CALLS ITSELF DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY (RECURSION MEANS THAT REFERENCES ITSELF. ) AND THE CORRESPONDING FUNCTION IS CALLED A RECURSIVE FUNCTION.

RECURSION IN SQL IS TYPICALLY IMPLEMENTED USING COMMON TABLE EXPRESSIONS (CTES) SOMETIME WE ALSO USE SELFJOIN FOR RECURSION.

THIS FEATURE IS USEFUL FOR HIERARCHICAL DATA, SUCH AS ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURES OR TREE STRUCTURES, WHERE YOU NEED TO TRAVERSE AND MANIPULATE DATA WITH PARENT-CHILD RELATIONSHIPS.

**Self Join** : A self join is a regular join, but the table is joined with itself. This is useful when you need to compare rows within the same table.

SELECT e1.EmployeeID, e1.Name AS Employee, e2.Name AS Manager
FROM Employee e1
LEFT JOIN Employee e2 ON e1.ManagerID = e2.EmployeeID;
